# Barrack-Thar-Bazaar
The Barrack-Thar Bazaar caters to any and all adventurers, caravaneers,  guards, and soldiers! With dazzling products from every realm you'll not find our wares anywhere.

# Overview
The idea of Barrak-Thar is a fantastical shop interface, in the spirit of final fantasy, Dungeons and Dragons, and Amazon (weird combo, I know). It will have a search function, a randomized database of wares with prices set a bit too high so characters have the chance to bargain. The visual design is going to be "Eclectic antique store" mixed with the traditional arms store found in adventure movies.
